# Tarpaulin Course Management Tool

Portfolio project from Cloud Application Development course at OSU that involves a Rest API, Google Cloud project and its associated databases, to create an "alternative" course management tool to Canvas.

> In this assignment you will pull together all of the pieces you have worked on up to this point. You will implement a complete RESTful API for an application called Tarpaulin, a lightweight course management tool that's an "alternative" to Canvas. You can find more details about Tarpaulin below. The API you implement will utilize most of the components of a modern API that we have talked about in this class. You will deploy your application on Google Cloud Platform using Google App Engine and Datastore, using Python 3. You will use Auth0 for authentication.
